## Quality Review: DevOps Agent (MiniMax M2.1)

### Scores (1-10)
- Structure: 9/10
- Content: 9/10
- Examples: 9/10
- Overall: 9/10

### Issues Found

- **[LOW]** Lines 729, 747, 820: HTML entities (`&lt;&lt;`) appear in heredoc syntax - these are likely parsing artifacts from the original document and should be `<<` for correct heredoc behavior
- **[LOW]** Line 16: Missing trailing `---` in YAML frontmatter - technically optional but inconsistent with plugin standards
- **[MINOR]** Line 913: Uses 2025 date in cost estimation example - should be updated to 2026 for consistency

### Verdict

**APPROVED**

The DevOps agent demonstrates strong quality across all review dimensions:

**Insight**

1. **Extended Thinking Integration**: The agent properly embeds `TodoWrite` tracking throughout the 7-phase workflow, ensuring complex infrastructure decisions are methodically analyzed before implementation.

2. **Multi-Provider Coverage**: Knowledge section comprehensively covers AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and Firebase with copy-paste ready CLI commands - a rare breadth that reduces context switching for users.

3. **IaC Duality Pattern**: Each example provides both imperative CLI and declarative IaC alternatives (Terraform, CDK, Pulumi), respecting different team preferences and maturity levels.

The minor HTML entity issues in heredoc syntax are the only technical concerns. These should be corrected before merging, but don't affect the agent's core functionality when executed through Claude Code's agent system.
