# Autopilot Configuration

This file stores project-specific autopilot settings.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `.claude/autopilot.local.md`
2. Update the `linear` section with your team/project IDs
3. Customize tag mappings as needed
4. Adjust proof settings for your workflow

## Finding Linear IDs

### Team ID
1. Go to your Linear workspace
2. Click on team name in sidebar
3. Look at URL: `linear.app/[workspace]/team/[TEAM_ID]`

### Project ID
1. Open a project in Linear
2. Look at URL: `linear.app/[workspace]/project/[PROJECT_ID]`

### User ID
1. Go to Settings > API
2. Create a Personal API Key
3. Use the API to query your viewer ID

## Custom Notes

Add any project-specific notes here.

### Example: Project-specific routing

This project uses Go for backend, so we route @backend to Golang-specific skills.

### Example: Custom tags

- @migration - Database migration tasks
- @security - Security-related work
- @docs - Documentation updates
