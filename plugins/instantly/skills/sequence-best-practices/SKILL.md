# Sequence Best Practices

## Sequence Structure

### Standard 5-Step Sequence

| Step | Day | Purpose | Email Type |
|------|-----|---------|------------|
| 1 | 0 | Initial outreach | Problem + value prop |
| 2 | 3 | Social proof | Case study / results |
| 3 | 7 | Alternative angle | Different value prop |
| 4 | 10 | Soft breakup | "If not a fit..." |
| 5 | 14 | Breakup | Last attempt, value-add |

### Extended 7-Step Sequence

| Step | Day | Purpose | Email Type |
|------|-----|---------|------------|
| 1 | 0 | Initial outreach | Problem + value prop |
| 2 | 2 | Quick follow-up | Bump + new angle |
| 3 | 5 | Social proof | Case study |
| 4 | 8 | Value-add | Free resource |
| 5 | 12 | Alternative angle | Different ICP pain |
| 6 | 16 | Soft breakup | Check-in |
| 7 | 21 | Breakup | Final attempt |

## Timing Guidelines

### Optimal Delays

| Between Emails | Recommended | Reasoning |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Email 1 -> 2 | 2-3 days | Stay top of mind |
| Email 2 -> 3 | 3-4 days | Let social proof sink in |
| Email 3 -> 4 | 3-4 days | Give time to consider |
| Email 4 -> 5 | 4-5 days | Breakup needs space |
| After breakup | 30+ days | Cool-off period |

### Send Time Optimization

```
Best Days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Best Times:
  - 8-10am recipient local time (start of day)
  - 2-4pm recipient local time (post-lunch)

Worst Days: Monday morning, Friday afternoon
Worst Times: After 6pm, before 7am
```

## Email Copy Guidelines

### Length Guidelines

| Email Type | Word Count | Lines | Reason |
|------------|------------|-------|--------|
| Cold outreach | 50-100 | 5-8 | Scannable |
| Follow-up | 30-60 | 3-5 | Quick bump |
| Case study | 100-150 | 8-12 | Tell story |
| Breakup | 40-80 | 4-6 | Clear finale |

### Structure Template

```
[Personalized opening - 1 line]

[Problem statement or insight - 2-3 lines]

[Brief value proposition - 1-2 lines]

[CTA - 1 line]

[Signature]
```

### Subject Line Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep 3-7 words | Write novel-length subjects |
| Use {{first_name}} or {{company}} | Over-personalize ("Saw you on LinkedIn...") |
| Create curiosity | Mislead with clickbait |
| Be specific when possible | Use generic templates |
| Test lowercase | Use ALL CAPS |

**Examples:**
- Good: "{{first_name}}, quick question"
- Good: "idea for {{company}}'s Q2"
- Bad: "RE: Our meeting" (fake reply)
- Bad: "FREE TRIAL INSIDE!!!" (spam trigger)

### CTA Best Practices

| CTA Type | Example | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Soft | "Thoughts?" | Early in sequence |
| Medium | "Worth a quick chat?" | Middle of sequence |
| Direct | "15 min this week?" | After engagement signals |
| Breakup | "Should I close the loop?" | Final email |

**One CTA Per Email:** Never give multiple options.

## Personalization Strategy

### Personalization Tokens

| Token | Example | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| {{first_name}} | "Hey Sarah," | Required |
| {{company}} | "saw {{company}}'s recent..." | Recommended |
| {{title}} | "As a {{title}}, you..." | If relevant |
| {{industry}} | "In {{industry}}, we see..." | For segmented |

### Custom Personalization

| Level | Effort | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Basic | Low | {{first_name}}, {{company}} |
| Medium | Medium | + recent company news, role-specific |
| High | High | + mutual connections, specific insight |

**Rule:** Personalize opening line at minimum. Rest can be templated.

## Avoiding Spam Triggers

### Words to Avoid

```
FREE, GUARANTEE, WINNER, CASH, URGENT
Click here, Act now, Limited time, Don't miss
!!!!, ALL CAPS, $$$$
```

### Technical Best Practices

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| No images in cold emails | Trigger spam filters |
| Max 1 link per email | Multiple links = spam |
| No HTML formatting | Plain text performs better |
| Short sentences | Looks more personal |
| No attachments | Major spam trigger |

## Sequence Psychology

### Email 1: The Opening

**Goal:** Establish relevance, create curiosity
**Approach:** Problem-focused, not product-focused
**Length:** 50-80 words

### Email 2: The Follow-Up

**Goal:** Add credibility via social proof
**Approach:** "Here's what happened when..."
**Length:** 60-100 words

### Email 3: The Pivot

**Goal:** Try different angle
**Approach:** Different pain point or benefit
**Length:** 50-80 words

### Email 4: The Soft Breakup

**Goal:** Create scarcity without desperation
**Approach:** "If this isn't a priority..."
**Length:** 40-60 words

### Email 5: The Breakup

**Goal:** Last attempt, leave door open
**Approach:** Value-add (resource) + clear close
**Length:** 50-80 words
